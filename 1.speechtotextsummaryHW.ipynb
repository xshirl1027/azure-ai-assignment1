      "I'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest 2 billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation that leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest also the the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution and even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with CO2CO2 is warming the planet and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad I asked the top scientists in this several times do we really have to get down to near 0 can't we just you know cut it in half or 1/4 and the answer is that until we get near to 0 the temperature will continue to rise and so that's that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a 12 foot high truck trying to get under a 10 foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to 0 now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over 26 billion tons for each American it's about 20 tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about 5 tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to 0 this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left CO2 that you want to get to 0 and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person is using on average the energy on average for each service and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to 0 probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to 0 that's back from a high school algebra but let's let's take a look first we've got population the world today has 6.8 billion people that's headed up to about 9 billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15% but there we see an increase of about 1.3 the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we eat clothing TV heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top 1 billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street lamps now efficiency E the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by 90% there are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of 6 but for these first three factors now we've gone from 26 billion to at best maybe 13 billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this 4th factor this is going to be a key one and this is the amount of CO2 put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to 0 if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas now almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out CO2 and So what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when I use the term miracle I don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessor is a miracle the personal computer is a miracle the Internet and its services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually you just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now I thought how could I really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who live in mosquitoes so with energy all I could come up with is this I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fireflies I'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one but they don't really add up to much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions are people seeking I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers I've left out tide geothermal fusion biofuels those may make some contribution and if they can do better than I expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all have significant challenges let's look 1st at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the CO2 after you've burned it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80% level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and agree on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard but the toughest 1 here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of nuclear or other things this is a lot of volume so that's a tough one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems costs particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste although it's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five I've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area then you think of as a normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources the sun doesn't shine all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so if you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and to dimensionalize this I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now it's not it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the intermittent source to be above say 20 to 30% of what you're using if you're counting on it for 100% you need a an incredible miracle battery now how we're going to go forward on this what's the right approach is it a Manhattan Project what's the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least 100 people and a lot of them you'll look at and say they're crazy that's good and I think here in the Ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies including one called E solar that has some great solar thermal technology Vinod khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and I'm trying to help back that anathema and I actually are backing a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of a terror is that instead of burning the part of uranium the 1% which is the U235 we decided well let's burn the 99% EU 238 it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people had talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work and because you're burning that 99% you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle you can see it's it's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem and I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky this is the leftover the 99% where they've taken out the part they burn now so it's called depleted uranium that would power the US for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it's got lots lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and and then look at the intermediate for 2050 you've heard many people talk about this 80% reduction that really is very important that we get there and that 20% will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry cement so to get to that 80% the developed countries including countries like China will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether so the other great is are we deploying this zero emission technology we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of of getting it out elsewhere that's super important that's a key element of making that report card so backing up from there what should the 2020 report card look like well again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that sum will be of CO2 and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the pace of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed there's a lot of great books that have been written about this the Al Gore book our choice and the David Mackay book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and I think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years I can pick who's president I can pick a vaccine which is something I love or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented this is the wish I would pick this is the one with the greatest impact if we don't get this wish the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between the US and China between poor countries and rich and most of all the lives of those 2 billion will be far worse So what do we have to do what am I appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go for more research funding you know when countries get together at places like Copenhagen they shouldn't just discuss the CO2 they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives CO2 tax cap and trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one I think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you so thank you\n",
